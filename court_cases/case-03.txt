People v. Michael Brown

Charge: Ponzi Scheme
Summary:
Background: Michael Brown operated a Ponzi scheme disguised as an investment firm, promising investors returns of up to 20% per year. Over ten years, he defrauded investors of nearly $15 million, using new investments to pay off earlier investors while diverting funds for personal use.
Legal Arguments: The prosecution used financial records and testimony from former employees to demonstrate the fraudulent nature of Brown's operations. The defense argued that Brown was merely a poor businessman who over-promised and under-delivered.
Witness Statements: Several investors described the trust they had in Brown and the devastation of losing their retirement savings. An expert in securities fraud explained the typical patterns of a Ponzi scheme.
Verdict: Brown was convicted on multiple counts of fraud and sentenced to 30 years in prison. He was also ordered to repay the full amount lost by investors.
